# odin-recipes
In this project, I will be building a simple food recipe website.  The 
website will consist of a main index page and will have links to a few 
recipes.  With this website, we will practice with our html chops.  We 
will be practicing on using elements, tags, Doctypes, unordered/ordered
lines, etc.
