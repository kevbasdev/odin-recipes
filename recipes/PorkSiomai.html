        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Siomai made of ground pork, shrimp, and shitake mushrooms are tasty and filling. These steamed dumplings are easy to make and delicious as an appetizer, snack, or main meal!</p>
        <p>This siomai recipe was first published in 2013 and needed a little refresh, so I thought I’ll put on my dumpling-making hat today and take new pictures as well as add cooking tips.</p>
        <p>But although it took me five years and a day to finally revamp the post, I do make these steamed dumplings on a regular basis. They’re one of the make-ahead meals I like to stock up for busy weeknight dinners, midday snacks, or impromptu parties.</p>
        <p>I usually prep and steam a few dozens every week or so, and then freeze them in airtight containers. On days when I am too busy to cook or just want a quick dim sum fix, I pop a few pieces in the microwave for a few seconds or steam them for a few minutes to warm up.</p>

        <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 medium dried shitake mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>1/4 pound large shrimp, peeled, deveined and finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 thumb-size ginger, peeled, grated, and juice extracted</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>1 package (30 pieces) shumai wrappers</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Dipping Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>calamansi or lemon juice to taste</li>
            <li>soy sauce to taste</li>
            <li>chili garlic to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl with warm water, soak shiitake mushrooms until softened. Using hands, squeeze liquid and then mince.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine ground pork, shrimp, mushroom, ginger juice, soy sauce, salt, sugar, and pepper until well-distributed.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine corn starch and water, Stir until cornstarch is dissolved and add to pork mixture.</li>
            <li>Mix pork mixture until very sticky.</li>
            <li>Separate wrappers into individual sheets. Spoon a heaping tablespoonful of meat mixture on the middle of the wrapper and then gather sides to form a “cup” around the filling. Repeat with the remaining mixture.</li>
            <li>Arrange siomai in a single layer about 1/4-inch apart on a lightly greased steamer basket and steam for about 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked through.</li>
            <li>Gently remove from steamer and serve hot with dipping sauce.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Dipping Sauce</h3>

            <li>In a small bowl, compine calamansi juice, soy sauce and chili garlic sauce</li>
        </ol>
